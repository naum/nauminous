Here I attempt the grandiose task of logging a roundup of [Big Tent Christianity 2011](http://www.bigtentchristianity.com/ "Big Tent Christianity"), a conference about "convergence of new and old ways of being and becoming the Church", that I actually requested vacation time to attend last week (Thursday and Friday).

>BTX brings people together from across the country to proclaim what unites us as followers of Jesus in this modern world. More than a dozen leading Christian voices will break through boundaries to share new and innovative forms of ministry and renewal. You will be inspired by their visions of how we can speak even more powerfully in and to the world of the 21st century.

While the words here at this online ranch hit all over the political map, but predominately sway to left of center, in the perspective of most, I reckon. Theologically speaking, however, I am much more in the conservative camp. Not a fire and brimstone inerrantist fundamentalist by any stretch, but I do believe in the sacredness of the bible text. And not that it's a collection of misty fairy tales, but a central theological motif based on the Kingdom of God.

So for a few days, I was treated to bunch of "leading Christian voices" speaking on "big tent Christianity", and here is my take of all the chatter and prattle.

### Who I heard speak

* [Tripp Fuller](http://homebrewedchristianity.com/ "Homebrewed Christianity") — Did not put together that Tripp is the proprietor of Homebrewed Christianity podcast where I have listened to some fantastic interviews with various theologians. Tripp served up some of the musical interludes too.

* [Carol Howard Merritt](http://tribalchurch.org/?page_id=2 "TribalChurch.org") — Gave a talk on _Healing the Wounds of Religion_. 

* [Philip Clayton](http://philipclayton.net/about1/) — Just not able to grok Philip's takes at all. And, I do not how to frame this in a more charitable fashion — he came off as rude and condescending.

* [Rachel Held Evans](http://rachelheldevans.com/ "Rachel Held Evans | Blog") — Wanted to tell Rachel in person how much I enjoyed reading _Evolving in Monkey Town_ but every time I attempted to approach, she was speaking to somebody else.

* [Gary Kinnaman](http://v2.garykinnaman.com/?page_id=2 "About | Gary Kinnaman") — The "token" evangelical conservative on the panel, also conducted a breakout session on immigration that was rather interesting: Gary has taken this issue up, compiled evidence, and even visited lawmakers in support of immigration reform. His presentation, however, seemed more suited for folks at my church, and not this crowd, who are not the flock of the conservative pastor who frequently tune into right wing talk radio. I felt bad for Gary, that the audience is unaware of the shitstorm Gary entered as I imagine that a good number of his former flock pan him as a turncoat. He also had one of the best lines of the conference: _["you know you arrived when people ask you to sign your son's book"](https://twitter.com/#!/naum/status/35747983299452928)_ 

* [Eliacin Rosario-Cruz](http://eliacin.com/ "Eliacín Rosario-Cruz") — Eliacin served as cochair with Gary Kinnaman in the immigration breakout session. 

* [Derek Webb](http://derekwebb.com/ "Buy Derek Webb's new instrumental album 'Feedback' | Exclusively Available at DerekWebb.com") — Prior to conference, I was not acquainted with the music of Derek Webb. Wow, what an incredibly gifted musician. /em heading off to iTunes to hear more :)

* [Brian McLaren](http://www.brianmclaren.net/ "Brian McLaren") — Have read a number of Mr. Brian McLaren's books, including his latest, _A New Kind of Christianity_. They're all OK, I don't see what the all fuss is about, from either detractors or adherents. Here, his talk seemed to be flat. It could just be me, though.

* [Marcus Borg](http://www.marcusborg.com/ "") — Found it be rather curious that a conference would bill itself as "big tent" and then feature a keynote speaker that would completely dis the foundational tract all a bible believing Christian holds dear — that Jesus resurrection is a fable. The audience cheered his pronouncements of panentheism. I see where he is coming from, but the evening sounded more like "how stupid them that believe this are" rather than "big tent" unity and professions of Christian love. Just saying.

* [Brian Ammons](http://nekkidresurrection.com/ "Nekkid Resurrection") — Delivered a very eloquent talk on sexuality and gender. [Asking the question](http://nekkidresurrection.com/2011/01/27/big-tent-masculinity/ "Big Tent Masculinity &laquo;  Nekkid Resurrection"): "Why, as people of faith, must we assume that the gender of my partner choice is the defining aspect of my sexual identity?" Brian also recited his [open letter to the Bishop](http://nekkidresurrection.com/open-letter-to-the-bishop/ "Open Letter  &laquo;  Nekkid Resurrection").

* [Mark Scandrette](http://www.markscandrette.com/ "Mark Scandrette") — Mark shared the Jesus Dojo with the crowd. Full of energy and passion, Mark's zeal for speaking on [practicing the way of Jesus](http://www.markscandrette.com/spiritual-practices/a-teaser-for-my-new-book-practicing-the-way-of-jesus/ "Mark Scandrette  &raquo; A teaser for my new book, Practicing the Way of Jesus.") seemed to be unbound by the constraints of time. While the conference featured a lot of intellectual theorizing, Mark struck me as an elder Shane Claiborne, doing the Gospel, instead of merely talking about it. 

* [Nadia Bolz-Weber](http://www.nadiabolzweber.com/) — Hot damn, a tattooed, cussing evangelical Lutheran pastor that tells it like it is. She is real, and I enjoyed listening to her speak on both her life journey and praxis at the church she has built and grown. Even if she professed dislike for conservative evangelical folk like me. 

* [Shane Hipps](http://marshill.org/shane-hipps/ "Mars Hill - Shane Hipps &#8211; Bio") — Been a big fan of Shane, dating back to when he served as a Mennonite pastor of a [church just down the road from me](http://www.trinitymennonite.com/ "Trinity Mennonite Church"). Ever since reading _[Flickering Pixels](http://www.shanehipps.com/books.htm "Shane Hipps")_, he was entered into my iTunes podcast subscriptions, and when he matriculated to Mars Hill, I did not have to add another feed, as Rob Bell was already in there. After some back and forth dialogue in a breakout session on _Technology and Soul_, he called me a _technophile_ (in contrast to someone he termed a _technophobe_, sitting behind me). It did strike that what Rob and Shane are doing at Mars Hill is much more in tune with "Big Tent Christianity" than most of what I observed at this conference.

* [Richard Rohr](http://www.cacradicalgrace.org/aboutus/founder.html "Our Founder") — _The Naked Now_ has been on my Amazon wish list for some time now, based on recommendations read elsewhere. His talk was intriguing, and I felt shorted as Rohr just seemed to be getting in the groove of sharing his numinous take on spirituality. Nabbed a copy of _The Naked Now_ over the weekend, started devouring and thus far, am enraptured.

* [Anthony Smith](http://postmodernegro.wordpress.com/ "Musings of a Postmodern Negro") — just like in the case of Richard Rohr, wish I could have heard more from [postmodernnegro](https://twitter.com/#!/postmodernegro).

### What I observed

* A great bit of discussion about prayer but almost zero practice. That is in vivid contrast to other church conferences I have attended where prayer and ministry are integral part of the proceedings.

* Lots of grumpy old farts devoid of any joy. Say what can be said about the dogmatic and intransigent nature of some conservative Christians, but on the whole, they seem to retain a sense of humor.

### What I learned

* Progressive Christians appear to be upfront about their political leanings. In conservative evangelical churches, politics rarely takes center stage, but there were numerous references to political doings here. And not just in a global "empire" sense, but specific politicians and policy planks.

* That both mainliner liberal and fundamentalist Baptist alike loathe the megachurch. Or, as it was referred to, by some, as "movie theater" churches.
