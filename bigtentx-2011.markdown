Here I attempt the grandiose task of logging a roundup of [Big Tent Christianity 2011](http://www.bigtentchristianity.com/ "Big Tent Christianity"), a conference about "convergence of new and old ways of being and becoming the Church".

>BTX brings people together from across the country to proclaim what unites us as followers of Jesus in this modern world. More than a dozen leading Christian voices will break through boundaries to share new and innovative forms of ministry and renewal. You will be inspired by their visions of how we can speak even more powerfully in and to the world of the 21st century.
